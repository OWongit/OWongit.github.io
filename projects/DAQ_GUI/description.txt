Raspberry Pi–based DAQ system that uses two ADS124S08 ADCs (via spidev and gpiod) to read multiple sensors (load cells, pressure transducers, RTDs) at 10 Hz, convert the voltages into physical units, and continuously log them to timestamped CSV files. At the same time, it runs a Flask + Flask-SocketIO web server that streams live data and system stats to a dashboard, where Tailwind CSS handles the styling and Smoothie.js renders real-time graphs, with options to view values and download the logged data.

a. The GUI presents real-time, auto-scaling plots of sensor data, along with a Raspberry Pi/web server connectivity status indicator and system resource metrics (CPU, RAM, and disk utilization). It also provides a control to download a CSV file containing all sensor data recorded during the session.
b. The GUI supports visualization of up to 11 sensors and automatically arranges their plots in a structured layout. Individual graphical views can be easily enabled or disabled via configuration options in config.py.
