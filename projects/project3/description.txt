Develop an improved Data Acquisition (DAQ) system utilizing a Raspberry Pi 5 microcontroller, engineered to process analog signal data from three load cells and five pressure transducers.

Image 1: Schematic for the DAQ system. Analog sensor data is acquired via two 15-port external connection terminals and processed by two 24-bit, 12-channel analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) before being relayed to a Raspberry Pi microcontroller. The board is powered by a 10 V supply, with a regulated 5 V rail provided by a fixed positive low-dropout (LDO) regulator and a precise 5 V reference generated by a dedicated precision voltage reference component.
Image 2: PCB layout for the DAQ system is designed to ensure thermal management and optimal grounding. An array of thermal vias is implemented to facilitate efficient heat dissipation and establish electrical connectivity between the front and back ground planes. Additionally, trace widths vary to accommodate the current draw of each component, ensuring reliable power distribution.
Image 3: 3D rendering of the PCB provides a visual representation of both the front and back sides, with the front side positioned at the bottom. The front and back silk layer labeling of components ensures clarity in component placement and routing, ideally helping with manufacturing accuracy.
