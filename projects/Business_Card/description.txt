NFC-enabled business card that, when tapped with a smartphone, harvests energy from the phone’s field to send a LinkedIn URL, with surrounding circuitry driving LEDs as active communication indicators.

a. The NFC chip harvests energy from the phone’s field to generate VCC/VOUT, which drives a “phone detected” LED as a simple “powered by NFC” indicator. Its field-detect output controls a “read status” LED, illuminating only while NFC communication is active.
b. Compact circuitry manages the NFC chip and LED behavior. No copper or components are placed inside the antenna loop to avoid degrading the RF signal.
